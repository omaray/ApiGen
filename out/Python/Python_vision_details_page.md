Learn about using the Google Cloud Vision API with Python

Cloud Vision API allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content. To learn more about Google Cloud Vision, see [What is Google Cloud Vision?](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/)

* Read the [getting started guide](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/getting-started).
* Learn how to develop using the [Python client library](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/apis/).
* Interact with the API in the browser, using [Google APIs Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/vision/v1/).

## Install the Google Python Client library
To install the Python library, you must use [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)

```
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
```
